Throughout the course of this project, there were many lessons learned. The biggest obstacle in the beginning was understanding the project topic, as it had been suggested to us by Dr. Ford. As a result, our understanding of not only the science but also the approach taking place in an example code using the Hermite polynomials needed to drastically improve. In that way, we both grew as programmers trying to understand another person's code, and we tried to utilize those same skills during the peer review as well. In addition to this, we had to be able to quickly adapt and expand from the initial idea to incorporate more that we wanted to do while still maitaining the original science goal. 
A very large lesson learned was parallelization, both in terms of the multi-core and the distributed memory versions. Neither of us had any experience with parallelization before, so the biggest hurdle at first was wrapping our heads around the concepts that had to be implemented, and what the best method would be. Then the next big hurdle was successfully editing the serial version to implement these concepts. As a result, we learned that certain parallelizations, such as Threads.@threads, were easier to add into the program than others, such as the distributed memory.
Another aspect that was learned along the way, mostly through the labs and that was slightly implemented in our project, was the importance of memory allocation and how it can affect the run time and performance of the program.
