There will be one main notebook. This notebook will do these things:
1) Load in Data
2) Remove the Blaze
3) Create a list of lines to fit to
4) Fit to the lines using parallel function
5) Output GH coefficients from step 4
6) Interpret the GH coefficients


There will also be a tester script
-This will run the serial and parallel version on a made up line that should fit perfectly
-This will run the serial and parallel version on a made up line that should fit very poorly (like a delta function or something)
-This will run the serial and parallel version on one (or a few, or all) of the real lines

-All three above runs should produce the exact same result


There will also be a benchmarking script
-Take the three above runs from before and time them. The timing should show a significant change from serial to parallel


There will be a file that holds all the helper functions, like the fitting functions and the blaze removal functions.
